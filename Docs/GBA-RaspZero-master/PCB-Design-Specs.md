## PCB Design Info

Software: Cadsoft Eagle (https://cadsoft.io/) 
Note: I have a non-commercial ‘Maker’ license. This allows a slightly larger board size than the free version. This means that if you try to edit (viewing should be ok) the PCB with the free version you may have difficulty.
I apologise for this but I wasn’t expecting to release it.

**PCB Specs:**

1.	Layers: 2
2.	PCB Thickness: 1.0mm (This is important!)
3.	Copper Weight: 1oz
4.      PCB size: 10cm Max * 16cm Max +$28.50
5.	Surface Finish: Lead free HASL. (ENIG would be better but costs more)

The PCB fab I used for the main PCB is Elecrow (http://www.elecrow.com/). I am not affiliated with them in anyway.
If you decide to use this company, I specifically used this service:

If you make any modifications to the PCB, you can read the wiki on Elecrow’s website for help on how to regenerate the Gerbers.
The small Flat flex cable adapter can be purchased directly from:
https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/9tH3I87q
This was not possible with the main PCB as OSHPark don’t offer a 1.0mm PCB thickness.
