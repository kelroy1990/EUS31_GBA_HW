## FAQ and anticipated FAQ


**Q: How’d you learn all this:**

A: I’m an Electrical Engineer and its my career, but I do PCB design as a hobby only. I don’t do board level design at work!
If you want to get into electronics this is NOT the only pathway, but it’s difficult for me to provide advice for your personal case. Mine is a long hard road and certainly not the best/most efficient way for you.

**Q: Are you making DIY Kits that I can just buy?**

A: I have no plans to do this. The info I have provided should be enough to get everything you need. Another redditor /u/Flav0r has designed something quite similar to this. See http://gamepieadvance.com/ I understand he may be working on DIY Kits.

**Q: I can view the PCB but can’t edit it?**

A: Great to see you having a play with it. However, I must apologise as I did not expect to share this and it exceeds the size limitations for the Free version of eagle. I have a non-commercial ‘Maker’ license. If you’re a student I think you can get this for free.

**Q: What software does the Raspberry Pi Run?**

A: https://retropie.org.uk/ - A system specifically designed for emulators.

**Q: How long does is take to boot up?**

A: I measured this at around 1 minute 15 seconds.

**Q: Can you build me one? Name a price!**

A: Sorry, I’d love to help people out, but I don’t want to turn my hobby into an income stream. I do this for fun and don’t want to ruin it for myself.

**Q: What’s the battery life like?**

A: A very nominal power consumption is 330mA. The batteries I recommend are good quality Lithium AAs. These should give approximately 3000mAH before you have issues. This is a theoretical time of around 9 hours but don’t expect this. 5-6 hours is a more ‘real-life’ number.

**Q: How does the TFT screen perform over SPI?**

A: I am using Notro’s FBTFT framebuffer driver. https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/Framebuffer-use. Quote: *“Snapshotting takes ~10ms and with a 25ms delay it gives roughly 1000/(10+25) = 28fps CPU usage: ~2%”*

**Q: Why didn’t you…. <insert feature here>?**

A: I got lots of great ideas and additions from people. I designed it for myself and the time/money I was willing to spend on it.

**Q: What’s the cost?**

A: Get a quote for the PCB and add up the BOM cost. Your shipping rates may vary a lot from mine (To Australia).

**Q: I have this issue can you help me?**

A: Any support I provide is out of the kindness of my heart. I may or may not respond depending if I see it/have time.
